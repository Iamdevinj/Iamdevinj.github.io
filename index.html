    <div>
        <p>My name is Devin Jenkins, and I am 29 years old.
        I joined this class because I am in need of a career change.
        I figured that this class would be something that would challenge
        me, but also help me get into a career field that is rapidly
        evolving. I also chose this path to better my familial & financial life.
